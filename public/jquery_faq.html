	<dt>What do I need to do to get a web page on the Internet?</dt>
		<dd class='invisible dd'>1. First you need to make the web page. There are various programs you can use to help you make it, including Netscape (which is free), or you can put the page together in a text editor using the straight HTML (HyperText Markup Language -- the code web pages are in). Simple HTML is pretty easy. (I won't go into the details here since there are so many terrific resources out there on how to build a web page, and about HTML. Take a look at our extensive collection of links on the resources page.)<br>

If you use a program like Netscape, you should know that what you see isn't always what you get - you could be trying to center a table, and then realize it's not centered at all when you view it. There are lots of little nuances like that, so you will need to fine-tune it by hand. I recommend Dreamweaver, since it produces fairly clean code. I do not recommend Netscape to design pages in, but if you are just learning and want an editor that's free, it could be a good way to start getting practice.<br>

As far as graphics go, you could make your own using a graphics program (Paint Shop Pro is a great and affordable program; Photoshop is powerful, expensive, and the graphics-industry standard) or use pictures off the internet. There are lots of sites that have clipart, animations, etc. for your use. Just be sure that you are not stealing anyone else's work and that no copyrights have been violated. Read the policy on the page you're getting the graphics from (although that isn't always good enough -- be careful!)<br>

2. Then you need a place to put it (or 'host' it). There are free places to host it (see the resources page for links) or you can pay for hosting it. There are advantages and disadvantages to each.<br>

Being free is great - saving money is always an advantage, but you don't always have a lot of control over your pages. Ads will often be included, downloading may be slow, and the web address may be long and hard to remember.<br>

Costs vary greatly. I've seen anywhere from free to hundreds of dollars to host a web site. See our resources page for links to web hosts. (Note: if you buy web design services from us, we can either work with your host, or provide one for you.)<br>

Some ISPs offer free web hosting for their customers. Many have limits, such as terms that allow only non-commercial pages to be hosted, or limits in the amount of space you are given. Be sure to inquire with your provider.<br>

3. Finally, you'll also need a way to get it from your computer where you made the page, to the computer that will hold the page. This can be done with a file transfer program (FTP) like WS_FTP (the Limited Edition is free), CuteFTP or others.</dd>
	<dt>What is the internet?</dt>
		<dd class='invisible dd'>A vast global network of computers connected by wires (phone lines, cable lines, DSL - digital subscriber lines, etc.)<br>

When people talk about the Web, that is not the Internet, just a piece of it. E-mail, chat rooms, newsgroups, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - all of these things make up the Internet.</dd>
	<dt>How do I get on the internet?</dt>
		<dd class='invisible dd'>If you are not hooked up at all, but would like to be, you either need an ISP (Internet Service Provider) or a Web TV hookup. An ISP is like a phone company. You may have a phone, but if you don't have any phone service, you can't make any calls. Likewise with the Internet. You may have a computer (did I mention that you need a computer and a modem?) but can't hook up to the internet without an ISP. Some people dial in through their school or work - find out if this is an option.<br>

ISPs generally cost $20 or less per month. There are also some free ISPs as well. Since they need to make money somehow, they generate it through advertising revenue. If you can put up with some annoying banner ads flashing on your screen to save the monthly fee, you should look into this. Please be sure to check out their privacy policy as well - they may give your personal information away. Make sure you know what you're getting into. I have some links to free ISPs on our resources page.<br>

You also need a computer with a modem or a TV. You do not necessarily need the fastest computer out there, depending on what your needs are. However, computer prices have been pretty good! If you decided to buy something new, find out about a company's warranties and service plans -- it may be worth it to have a service plan that includes repair visits.

	<dt>What is a search engine?</dt>
		<dd class='invisible dd'>A program that searches the web for keywords that you give it. Like Google (www.google.com) or Altavista (www.altavista.com).<br>

If you know the exact URL (e.g.: www.wavian.com), you don't need to use a search engine - just type it in your browser window. Sometimes this can be confusing because when you open Netscape (for example), you are looking at Netscape's search box, but that's not where to type in the URL (Uniform Resource Locator, or Web address). You type it in the place where you see the http://blahblahblah address already there. (Or click on 'file', 'open', and type it in the window that opens up.)</dd>
	<dt>What is a domain name? What does it mean to have it registered?</dt>
		<dd class='invisible dd'>A domain name is the name of your company on the web, like www.amazon.com or www.birds.net. You must apply for a domain name with a domain registrar. It's like registering a business name. Someone has to keep track of all the names out there and make sure that when a user types in your URL that they get to your page. ICANN is the organization behind this. Wavian Web Design can do your domain name registration for you or you can register for one yourself.<br>

It's a good idea to see if your idea for a domain name is already taken - you can check in numerous places (like www.dotster.com or www.godaddy.com).<br>

Note: If you're not prepared to buy your domain name when you're searching, be wary of the possibility that you may lose it; names get snapped up quickly. Also, I have no proof of this but I am not completely convinced that domain squatters aren't spying on searched names in the hopes of snapping them up to then sell to you. When you're ready, act quickly.

	<dt>I need my site hosted. What does that mean?</dt>
		<dd class='invisible dd'>That's like renting virtual space for an office. You need to have your site on a computer somewhere so that anyone, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, can access it. The companies that provide this service are often called hosting companies (ISP's (Internet Service Providers) often host pages as well).<br>

Sure, you could have your site on your own computer and just leave it hooked up to the net all the time, but you would need to know a lot about computers to set this up correctly and guard against hacker attacks. Luckily, it doesn't cost a lot to have someone else host your site, and they will take care all of the details for you. Wavian can also act as the middleman and set up hosting and email services for you or we can work with the provider of your choice.</dd>
	<dt>What is a URL? What does HTTP and HTML mean?</dt>
		<dd class='invisible dd'>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the address of your site. My URL is http://www.wavian.com. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, but there are other transfer protocols too, like FTP (file transfer protocol). Web pages are written in HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language. It is not a programming language, but rather a markup language. It doesn't do anything special like programming languages can do, it just specifies how a page should look (like what should be bold and whatnot). Though HTML is simple, there are lots of tricky factors to consider when making a web page. There's a ton of terrific info out there if you are interested in learning.</dd>
	<dt>What is an IP address?</dt>
		<dd class='invisible dd'>An IP address is the numerical address of your site. This is what computers translate your domain name to, although this happens behind the scenes. Rowan University's - (my old school) IP address was 150.250.1.1.</dd>
